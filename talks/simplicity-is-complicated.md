## Success

What makes Go successful?

* Speed of compilation
* Speed of execution
* Deployment
* Tools
* Libraries

Which are not language features, these are superficial reasons. All are important but not really the answer.

## Simplicity

Go is simple, at least compared to established languages. Simplicity has many facets. Simplicity is complicated.

## Convergence

Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, C++, PHP actively borrow features from one another, they are converging into a single huge language.

## Language relativity

_Sapir-Whorf hypothesis_: Language influences thought.

Controversial with regard to human languages.

Close to a fact for computer languages. Consider:

* Logic programming
* Procedural programming
* Functional programming
* Object-oriented programming
* Concurrent programming

Like disciplines in mathematics. Like, you don't solve Calculus with Algebra even though they share semantics.

## Convergence and relativity

If the languages all converge, we will all think the same.

But different ways of thinking are good.
