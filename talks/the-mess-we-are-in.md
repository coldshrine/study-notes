## Seven deadly sins
1. Code even you cannot understand a week after you wrote it. **No comments**
  - We should write really big comments. A book!
2. Code with **no specifications**.
3. Code that is shipped as soon as it runs and before it is beautiful
4. Code with added features
5. Code that is very very fast very very **very obscure** and incorrect
6. Code that is **not beautiful**
7. Code that you wrote withut understanding the problem
