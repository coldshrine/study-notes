## What is feedback

* Tech lead role
* Conways law

### Systems theory

`input -> simple design -> output`

Feedback new inputs into the system with a delay

Adaptive system changes its behaviour when feeded with feedback

* **Accelerating loop**: amplifies behaviour
    [positive] amplifier for a guitar
    [negative] financial aid, you make adiction
    [negative] meds
* **Diminishing loop**: suppreses behaviour
* **Balancing loop**: fedback tends to towards table goal
      - You help me I help you
      - The outlet of the factory has to be upstream (so factories won't contaminate their own water)
* **Oscilating/trashing loop**: feedbackflips between states
  - Like a shower, too hot, too cold, bad experience. If you introduce a delay you can control it a bit.
