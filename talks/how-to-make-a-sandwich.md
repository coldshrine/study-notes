## What is feedback

* Tech lead role
* Conways law

### Systems theory

`input -> simple design -> output`

Feedback new inputs into the system with a delay

Adaptive system changes its behaviour when feeded with feedback

* **Accelerating loop**: amplifies behaviour
    [positive] amplifier for a guitar
    [negative] financial aid, you make adiction
    [negative] meds
* **Diminishing loop**: suppreses behaviour
* **Balancing loop**: fedback tends to towards table goal
      - You help me I help you
      - The outlet of the factory has to be upstream (so factories won't contaminate their own water)
* **Oscilating/trashing loop**: feedbackflips between states
  - Like a shower, too hot, too cold, bad experience. If you introduce a delay you can control it a bit.

Timing in feedback is everything. **Small and frequent** is better than **large and infrequent** to people. Anual reviews, I'm gonna tell you something bad that you did 11 months ago any delay on receiving feedback means that you are basically going blind

- Reduces responsiveness
- Limits the options (to react to that)
- Increases processing effort for the feedback (compared to TDD, continuous integrations, small frequent batches, much more controls)

### Why do we ask for feedback?

* To **improve** or modify our behaviour
* For **help**, validation when we are stuck
* _For **recognition**, when we think we are doing okay_

### Why do we offer feedback?

* To **improve** the system of work (improving the team)
* To **model a culture** of encouring feedback
* _To **control** others_
* _To demonstrate our **superior knowledge**_

You have to question your motives, on why are you really offering feedback.
