# [Managing The Development of Large Software Systems](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci201/lectures/Lecture11/royce1970.pdf)

The context for this paper was related with the development of software packages for spacecraft mission planning, commanding and post-flight analysis.

There are two essential steps of computer programs regardless of the size or complexity: Analysis and coding. However, manufacturing large software projects taking into account only these steps ia doomed to failure.

A more grandiose approach precedes two levels of requirement analysis, separated by a design step and followed by a testing step. These steps are separated because they are planned and staffed differently in terms of resources.
