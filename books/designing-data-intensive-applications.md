# Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

A data-intensive application is typically built from standard building blocks. They usually need to:

- Store data (databases)
- Speed up reads (caches)
- Search data (search indexes)
- Send a message to another process asynchronously (stream processing)
- Periodically crunch data (batch processing)

## Key Goals

1. **Reliability**: To work correctly even in the face of adversity.
2. **Scalability**: Reasonable ways of dealing with growth.
3. **Maintainability**: Be able to work on it productively.

---

## Reliability

### Typical Expectations:

- Application performs the function the user expected.
- Tolerates the user making mistakes.
- Its performance is good.
- The system prevents abuse.

Systems that anticipate faults and can cope with them are called **fault-tolerant** or **resilient**.

- A **fault** is usually defined as one component of the system deviating from its spec, whereas a **failure** is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user.
- You should generally prefer **tolerating faults** over **preventing faults**.

### Types of Faults

1. **Hardware Faults**:
   - Until recently, redundancy of hardware components was sufficient for most applications.
   - As data volumes increase, more applications use a larger number of machines, proportionally increasing the rate of hardware faults.
   - There is a move towards systems that tolerate the loss of entire machines. A system that tolerates machine failure can be patched one node at a time, without downtime of the entire system (**rolling upgrade**).

2. **Software Errors**:
   - Unlike hardware, software errors are systematic and tend to cause many more system failures.
   
3. **Human Errors**:
   - Humans are known to be unreliable. Configuration errors by operators are a leading cause of outages.
   - Ways to make systems more reliable:
     - Minimize opportunities for error, e.g., admin interfaces that make it easy to do the "right thing" and discourage the "wrong thing".
     - Provide fully featured non-production sandbox environments where people can explore and experiment safely.
     - Automated testing.
     - Quick and easy recovery from human error:
       - Fast rollback of configuration changes.
       - Gradual rollout of new code.
       - Tools to recompute data.
     - Detailed and clear monitoring, such as performance metrics and error rates (**telemetry**).
     - Implement good management practices and training.

---

## Scalability

This is how to cope with increased load. First, succinctly describe the current load on the system; only then can growth questions be discussed.

### Twitter Example

#### Twitter Main Operations

1. **Post Tweet**: A user can publish a new message to their followers (4.6k req/sec, over 12k req/sec peak).
2. **Home Timeline**: A user can view tweets posted by the people they follow (300k req/sec).

#### Two Ways of Implementing Operations:

1. **Approach 1**:
   - Posting a tweet simply inserts the new tweet into a global collection of tweets.
   - When a user requests their home timeline, look up all the people they follow, find all the tweets for those users, and merge them (sorted by time). This could be done with a SQL JOIN.

2. **Approach 2**:
   - Maintain a cache for each user's home timeline.
   - When a user posts a tweet, look up all the people who follow that user, and insert the new tweet into each of their home timeline caches.

**Downside of Approach 2**:
- Posting a tweet now requires a lot of extra work. Some users have over 30 million followers, resulting in over 30 million writes to home timelines.

#### Hybrid Approach

- Tweets continue to be fanned out to home timelines, but a small number of users with a very large number of followers are fetched separately and merged with that user's home timeline when it is read, like in Approach 1.

---

### Describing Performance

#### What Happens When Load Increases?

- How is the performance affected?
- How much do you need to increase your resources?

In a batch processing system such as Hadoop, we usually care about **throughput**, or the number of records we can process per second.

#### Latency and Response Time

- **Response Time**: What the client sees.
- **Latency**: The duration a request is waiting to be handled.

##### Percentiles

- **Median (50th percentile or p50)**: Half of user requests are served in less than the median response time, and the other half take longer.
- **Percentiles 95th, 99th, and 99.9th (p95, p99, and p999)**: Indicate how bad the outliers are.

---

## Maintainability

The majority of the cost of software is in its ongoing maintenance. There are three design principles for software systems:

1. **Operability**: Make it easy for operation teams to keep the system running.
2. **Simplicity**: Easy for new engineers to understand the system by removing as much complexity as possible.
3. **Evolvability**: Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future.

---

### Operability: Making Life Easy for Operations

A good operations team is responsible for:

- Monitoring and quickly restoring service if it goes into a bad state.
- Tracking down the cause of problems.
- Keeping software and platforms up to date.
- Keeping tabs on how different systems affect each other.
- Anticipating future problems.
- Establishing good practices and tools for development.
- Performing complex maintenance tasks, like platform migration.
- Maintaining the security of the system.
- Defining processes that make operations predictable.
- Preserving the organizationâ€™s knowledge about the system.

Good operability means making routine tasks easy.

---

### Simplicity: Managing Complexity

When complexity makes maintenance hard, budget and schedules are often overrun. There is a greater risk of introducing bugs.

- Making a system simpler means removing **accidental complexity**, which is not inherent in the problem that the software solves (as seen by users).
- One of the best tools we have for removing accidental complexity is **abstraction**, which hides the implementation details behind clean and simple-to-understand APIs and facades.

---

### Evolvability: Making Change Easy

- Agile working patterns provide a framework for adapting to change.
- **Functional Requirements**: What the application should do.
- **Nonfunctional Requirements**: General properties like security, reliability, compliance, scalability, compatibility, and maintainability.
"""


# Data Models and Query Language

Most applications are built by layering one data model on top of another. Each layer hides the complexity of the layers below by providing a clean data model. These abstractions allow different groups of people to work effectively.

## Relational Model vs Document Model

The roots of relational databases lie in business data processing, transaction processing, and batch processing.

The goal was to hide the implementation details behind a cleaner interface.

Not Only SQL has a few driving forces:

- Greater scalability
- Preference for free and open source software
- Specialized query optimizations
- Desire for a more dynamic and expressive data model

With a SQL model, if data is stored in relational tables, an awkward translation layer is introduced. This is called impedance mismatch.

The JSON model reduces the impedance mismatch, and the lack of schema is often cited as an advantage.

JSON representation has better locality than the multi-table SQL schema. All the relevant information is in one place, and one query is sufficient.

In relational databases, it's normal to refer to rows in other tables by ID, because joins are easy. In document databases, joins are not needed for one-to-many tree structures, and support for joins is often weak.

If the database itself does not support joins, you have to emulate a join in application code by making multiple queries.

The most popular database for business data processing in the 1970s was IBM's Information Management System (IMS).

IMS used a hierarchical model and, like document databases, worked well for one-to-many relationships. However, it made many-to-many relationships difficult and didn't support joins.

## The Network Model

Standardized by a committee called the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL), the network model was a generalization of the hierarchical model. In the tree structure of the hierarchical model, every record has exactly one parent, while in the network model, a record could have multiple parents.

The links between records are like pointers in a programming language. The only way of accessing a record was to follow a path from a root record, called the access path.

A query in CODASYL was performed by moving a cursor through the database by iterating over a list of records. If you didn't have a path to the data you wanted, you were in a difficult situation, as it was hard to make changes to an application's data model.

## The Relational Model

By contrast, the relational model was a way to lay out all the data "in the open." A relation (table) is simply a collection of tuples (rows), and that's it.

The query optimizer automatically decides which parts of the query to execute in which order and which indexes to use (the access path).

The relational model thus made it much easier to add new features to applications.

The main arguments in favor of the document data model are schema flexibility, better performance due to locality, and sometimes closer data structures to those used by the applications. The relational model counters by providing better support for joins and many-to-one and many-to-many relationships.

If the data in your application has a document-like structure, then it's probably a good idea to use a document model. The relational technique of shredding can lead to unnecessarily complicated application code.

The poor support for joins in document databases may or may not be a problem.

If your application does use many-to-many relationships, the document model becomes less appealing. Joins can be emulated in application code by making multiple requests. Using the document model can lead to significantly more complex application code and worse performance.

## Schema Flexibility

Most document databases do not enforce any schema on the data in documents. Arbitrary keys and values can be added to a document, but when reading, clients have no guarantees as to what fields the documents may contain.

Document databases are sometimes called schemaless, but maybe a more appropriate term is schema-on-read, in contrast to schema-on-write.

- Schema-on-read is similar to dynamic (runtime) type checking, whereas schema-on-write is similar to static (compile-time) type checking.
- The schema-on-read approach is useful if the items in the collection don't have the same structure (heterogeneous data).

### Many Different Types of Objects

- Data determined by external systems

### Data Locality for Queries

If your application often needs to access the entire document, there is a performance advantage to this storage locality.

The database typically needs to load the entire document, even if you access only a small portion of it. On updates, the entire document usually needs to be rewritten, so it is recommended that you keep documents fairly small.

## Convergence of Document and Relational Databases

- PostgreSQL supports JSON documents.
- RethinkDB supports relational-like joins in its query language.
- Some MongoDB drivers automatically resolve database references.

Relational and document databases are becoming more similar over time.

## Query Languages for Data

SQL is a declarative query language. In an imperative language, you tell the computer to perform certain operations in order.

In a declarative query language, you just specify the pattern of the data you want, but not how to achieve that goal.

A declarative query language hides the implementation details of the database engine, making it possible for the database system to introduce performance improvements without requiring any changes to queries.

Declarative languages often lend themselves to parallel execution, while imperative code is very hard to parallelize across multiple cores because it specifies instructions that must be performed in a particular order. Declarative languages specify only the pattern of the results, not the algorithm used to determine results.

## Declarative Queries on the Web

In a web browser, using declarative CSS styling is much better than manipulating styles imperatively in JavaScript. Declarative languages like SQL turned out to be much better than imperative query APIs.

 # MapReduce Querying

MapReduce is a programming model for processing large amounts of data in bulk across many machines, popularized by Google.

Mongo offers a MapReduce solution:

```javascript
db.observations.mapReduce(
    function map() { // 2
        var year  = this.observationTimestamp.getFullYear();
        var month = this.observationTimestamp.getMonth() + 1;
        emit(year + "-" + month, this.numAnimals); // 3
    },
    function reduce(key, values) { // 4
        return Array.sum(values); // 5
    },
    {
        query: { family: "Sharks" }, // 1
        out: "monthlySharkReport" // 6
    }
);

The map and reduce functions must be pure functions. They cannot perform additional database queries and must not have any side effects. These restrictions allow the database to run the functions anywhere, in any order, and rerun them on failure.

A usability problem with MapReduce is that you have to write two carefully coordinated functions. A declarative language offers more opportunities for a query optimizer to improve the performance of a query. For these reasons, MongoDB 2.2 added support for a declarative query language called the aggregation pipeline:

db.observations.aggregate([
    { $match: { family: "Sharks" } },
    { $group: {
        _id: {
            year:  { $year:  "$observationTimestamp" },
            month: { $month: "$observationTimestamp" }
        },
        totalAnimals: { $sum: "$numAnimals" }
    } }
]);

# Graph-like Data Models

If many-to-many relationships are very common in your application, it becomes more natural to start modeling your data as a graph.

A graph consists of:
- **Vertices** (nodes or entities)  
- **Edges** (relationships or arcs)  

Well-known algorithms can operate on these graphs, like the shortest path between two points or the popularity of a web page.

There are several ways of structuring and querying the data:
- The **property graph model** (implemented by Neo4j, Titan, and Infinite Graph)  
- The **triple-store model** (implemented by Datomic, AllegroGraph, and others)  

There are also three declarative query languages for graphs:
- Cypher  
- SPARQL  
- Datalog  

---

## Property Graphs

Each **vertex** consists of:
- Unique identifier  
- Outgoing edges  
- Incoming edges  
- Collection of properties (key-value pairs)  

Each **edge** consists of:
- Unique identifier  
- Vertex at which the edge starts (tail vertex)  
- Vertex at which the edge ends (head vertex)  
- Label to describe the kind of relationship between the two vertices  
- A collection of properties (key-value pairs)  

Graphs provide a great deal of flexibility for data modeling and are good for evolvability.

---

### Cypher

Cypher is a declarative language for property graphs created by Neo4j.

---

### Graph Queries in SQL

In a relational database, you usually know in advance which joins you need in your query. In a graph query, the number of joins is not fixed in advance.

In Cypher, `:WITHIN*0...` expresses "follow a WITHIN edge, zero or more times" (like the `*` operator in a regular expression). 

This idea of variable-length traversal paths in a query can be expressed using something called **recursive common table expressions** (the `WITH RECURSIVE` syntax).

# Triple-stores and SPARQL

In a triple-store, all information is stored in the form of very simple three-part statements:  
**subject, predicate, object** (e.g., Jim, likes, bananas).  

A triple is equivalent to a vertex in a graph.

---

## The SPARQL Query Language

SPARQL is a query language for triple-stores using the RDF data model.

---

## The Foundation: Datalog

Datalog provides the foundation that later query languages build upon. Its model is similar to the triple-store model, but generalized a bit.  

Instead of writing a triple `(subject, predicate, object)`, we write it as `predicate(subject, object)`.

### Rules in Datalog
- Rules tell the database about new predicates.  
- Rules can refer to other rules, just like functions can call other functions or recursively call themselves.  
- Rules can be combined and reused in different queries.  

### Advantages
- Less convenient for simple one-off queries.  
- Better suited for complex data.  

---

## Storage and Retrieval

# Databases: Storage and Retrieval

Databases need to do two things: 
1. **Store the data**  
2. **Give the data back to you**  

---

## Data Structures That Power Your Database

Many databases use a **log**, which is an append-only data file. However, real databases also handle:
- Concurrency control  
- Reclaiming disk space to prevent unbounded log growth  
- Handling errors and partially written records  

### What Is a Log?  
A log is an append-only sequence of records.  

To efficiently find the value for a particular key, we need an additional structure: an **index**.  
- An index is derived from the primary data.  
- Well-chosen indexes speed up read queries but slow down writes.  
- Databases require manual index configuration based on typical query patterns.

---

## Hash Indexes

Key-value stores are similar to the dictionary type (hash map or hash table).

### Simplest Strategy:
- Use an **in-memory hash map** to map each key to a byte offset in the data file.  
- Append new key-value pairs to the file and update the hash map.  

#### Example: **Bitcask** (default storage engine in Riak)
- Keys must fit in available RAM.  
- Values can be loaded from disk if they exceed memory limits.  
- Suitable for frequent updates to values.  

---

### Managing Disk Space
1. **Segment Files**  
   - Split the log into segments when it reaches a certain size.  
   - Write subsequent data to a new segment.  

2. **Compaction**  
   - Remove duplicate keys and keep only the most recent update.  
   - Merge segments during compaction to reduce the number of segments.  

3. **Merged Segments**  
   - Written to a new file, ensuring old segments remain immutable.  
   - Read requests switch to the new segment after merging, and old segments are deleted.  

4. **In-Memory Hash Table**  
   - Each segment has its own hash table.  
   - Lookups start with the most recent segment and move backward as needed.  

---

## Important Considerations in Real Implementations

1. **File Format**  
   - Binary formats are simpler.  

2. **Deleting Records**  
   - Use a special deletion record ("tombstone") to mark entries for removal during merging.  

3. **Crash Recovery**  
   - Store snapshots of segment hash maps on disk to speed up recovery.  
   - Use checksums to detect and ignore corrupted parts of the log.  

4. **Concurrency Control**  
   - Sequential writes are handled by a single writer thread.  
   - Immutable segments enable concurrent reads by multiple threads.  

---

## Advantages of Append-Only Design

- Sequential writes (appending and merging) are faster than random writes, especially on magnetic spinning disks.  
- Simplifies concurrency and crash recovery.  
- Avoids file fragmentation over time.  

---

## Limitations of Hash Tables

1. **Memory Requirements**  
   - The hash table must fit in memory. On-disk hash maps are difficult to optimize.  

2. **Inefficient Range Queries**  
   - Hash tables are not suitable for range queries.  

# SSTables and LSM-Trees

We introduce a new requirement for segment files:  
The sequence of key-value pairs must be **sorted by key**.

---

## Sorted String Table (SSTable)

An SSTable requires:
1. Each key appears only once within a merged segment file (ensured by compaction).  

### Advantages of SSTables Over Log Segments with Hash Indexes:

1. **Efficient Merging**  
   - Merging segments is simple and efficient, leveraging algorithms like mergesort.  
   - When multiple segments contain the same key, the value from the most recent segment is kept, and older values are discarded.  

2. **Reduced Memory Usage**  
   - No need to keep an index of all keys in memory.  
   - For a key like `handiwork`, knowing the offsets for nearby keys (`handback` and `handsome`) allows a targeted search.  
   - You can jump to the offset for `handback` and scan until you find `handiwork`. If not found, the key is not present.  

3. **In-Memory Index Optimization**  
   - An in-memory index is still required to map some keys to offsets.  
   - Storing one key for every few kilobytes of the segment file is sufficient.  

4. **Compression**  
   - Records in the requested range can be grouped into blocks.  
   - Blocks are compressed before being written to disk.  
   
# How Do We Get the Data Sorted in the First Place?

With red-black trees or AVL trees, you can insert keys in any order and read them back in sorted order.

- When a write comes in, add it to an **in-memory balanced tree structure** (*memtable*).  
- When the memtable gets bigger than some threshold (megabytes), write it out to disk as an **SSTable file**. Writes can continue to a new memtable instance.  
- On a read request, try to find the key in the **memtable**, then in the most recent **on-disk segment**, then in the next-older segment, etc.  
- From time to time, run **merging and compaction** in the background to discard overwritten and deleted values.  

If the database crashes, the most recent writes are lost.  
To handle this:  
- Keep a separate **log on disk** where every write is immediately appended.  
  - The log is not in sorted order but helps restore the memtable after a crash.  
  - Every time the memtable is written out to an SSTable, the log can be discarded.  

---

# LSM-Structure Engines (Log Structured Merge-Tree)

Storage engines based on this principle of merging and compacting sorted files are often called **LSM structure engines**.

- **Lucene**, an indexing engine for full-text search used by Elasticsearch and Solr, uses a similar method for storing its term dictionary.  
- The **LSM-tree algorithm** can be slow when looking up keys that don't exist in the database.  

To optimize:  
- Use additional **Bloom filters** (a memory-efficient data structure for approximating the contents of a set).  

---

# Strategies for SSTable Compaction and Merging

There are different strategies to determine the order and timing of how SSTables are compacted and merged:  

1. **Size-Tiered Compaction**  
   - Newer and smaller SSTables are successively merged into older and larger SSTables.  
   - Used by **HBase**.  

2. **Leveled Compaction**  
   - The key range is split into smaller SSTables.  
   - Older data is moved into separate "levels", reducing disk space usage during compaction.  
   - Used by **LevelDB** and **RocksDB**.  

3. **Cassandra**  
   - Supports both size-tiered and leveled compaction.  

# B-Trees

The **B-tree** is the most widely used indexing structure.  

- **Key-value pairs** are sorted by key, enabling efficient key-value lookups and range queries.  
- The database is broken into **fixed-size blocks or pages**, traditionally 4KB, instead of variable-size segments as in log-structured indexes.  

---

## Structure and Operations

- **Root Page**: One page is designated as the root, and navigation starts from there.  
  - Contains keys and references to child pages.  

- **Updating an Existing Key**:  
  1. Search for the leaf page containing the key.  
  2. Update the value in that page.  
  3. Write the page back to disk.  

- **Adding a New Key**:  
  1. Find the appropriate page.  
  2. Add the key.  
  3. If the page is full, split it into two half-full pages.  
  4. Update the parent page to reflect the new subdivision of key ranges.  

- **Balancing**:  
  - B-trees remain balanced.  
  - A B-tree with *n* keys always has a depth of **O(log n)**.

---

## Write Operations

- **Overwrite-Based**:  
  - The basic operation overwrites a page on disk with new data.  
  - The location of the page remains unchanged, so references to the page remain intact.  
  - In contrast, **LSM-trees** (log-structured indexes) only append to files.  

- **Page Splits**:  
  - Some operations require multiple page overwrites.  
  - Example: When splitting a page, two pages are rewritten, and their parent page is also updated.  

- **Crash Scenarios**:  
  - If the database crashes after only some pages have been written, the index may be corrupted.  

---

## Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

- To ensure durability and consistency, an additional data structure, the **write-ahead log (WAL)** (also known as the redo log), is often used.  

---

## Concurrency Control

- If multiple threads access the B-tree:  
  - Careful concurrency control is required.  
  - Typically, **latches** (lightweight locks) protect the tree's internal data structures.  
  

# B-trees and LSM-trees

LSM-trees are typically faster for writes, whereas B-trees are thought to be faster for reads. Reads are typically slower on LSM-trees as they have to check several different data structures and SSTables at different stages of compaction.

## Advantages of LSM-trees:

- LSM-trees are typically able to sustain higher write throughput than B-trees, party because they sometimes have lower write amplification: a write to the database results in multiple writes to disk. The more a storage engine writes to disk, the fewer writes per second it can handle.  
- LSM-trees can be compressed better, and thus often produce smaller files on disk than B-trees. B-trees tend to leave disk space unused due to fragmentation.

## Downsides of LSM-trees:

- Compaction process can sometimes interfere with the performance of ongoing reads and writes. B-trees can be more predictable. The bigger the database, the more disk bandwidth is required for compaction. Compaction cannot keep up with the rate of incoming writes, if not configured properly you can run out of disk space.  
- On B-trees, each key exists in exactly one place in the index. This offers strong transactional semantics. Transaction isolation is implemented using locks on ranges of keys, and in a B-tree index, those locks can be directly attached to the tree.

# Other Indexing Structures

We've only discussed key-value indexes, which are like primary key index. There are also secondary indexes.

A secondary index can be easily constructed from a key-value index. The main difference is that in a secondary index, the indexed values are not necessarily unique. There are two ways of doing this: making each value in the index a list of matching row identifiers or by making a each entry unique by appending a row identifier to it.
