# [Microservices by Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)

Microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.

Built around business capabilities.

## Monolith
- A monolithic application built as a single unit. All your logic for handling a request runs in a single process.
- A change made to a small part of the application, requires the entire monolith to be rebuilt and deployed.
