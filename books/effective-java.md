## Creating and destroying objects

### Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

```java
public static Boolean valueOf(boolean b) {
  return b ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE;
}
```

Advantages:
* They have names.
* They are not required to create a new object each time they are invoked.
* They can return an object of any subtype of their return type.
* The class of the returned object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters.
* The class of the returned object need to exist when the class containing the method is written.

Disadvantages:
* Classes that provide only static factory methods without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed. This is preferable when using composition instead of inheritance.
* They are hard for programmers to find. Some conventions
  - `from`, as type-conversion method `Date d = Date.from(instant)`
  - `of`, an aggregation method `Set<Rank> faceCards = EnumSet.of(JACK, QUEEN, KING)`
  - `valueOf`, more verbose alternative than `from` and `of`, `BigInteger prime = BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE)`
  - `instance` or `getInstance`, returns and instance that cannot be said to have the same values, `StackWalker luke = StackWalker.getInstance(options)`
  - `create` or `newInstance` the method guarantees each call returns a new instance, `Object newArray = Array.newInstance(classObject, arrayLength)`
  - `get`**Type**, like `getInstance`but when factory method is in a different class `FileStore fs = Files.getFileStore(path)`
