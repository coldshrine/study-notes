# Introduction

Organizational design focuses on placing the right people in the right roles, giving them the authority to make decisions, and holding them accountable for their outcomes.

---

# Organizations

An organization is a group of individuals working together toward a common objective.

The goal of organizational design is to identify why some organizations foster high energy and productivity, while others generate more friction, frustration, and internal politics.

---

# Sizing Teams

A core challenge in organizational design is determining the appropriate size for teams.

- **Optimal Team Size for Managers**:  
  Managers should ideally oversee six to eight engineers. This allows sufficient time for coaching, coordination, and advancing the team’s mission through activities like strategy development and leading change initiatives.

- **Smaller Teams (<4 Engineers)**:  
  Managers of very small teams often act as Tech Lead Managers, actively contributing to design and implementation tasks alongside their team.

- **Larger Teams (>8–9 Engineers)**:  
  Managers of larger teams tend to adopt more of a coaching role, acting as a safety net and resolving issues as they arise.

  # Metrics and Baselines

## Decoupling the "What" from the "How"

Goals are structured to separate **what you want to achieve** from **how you plan to achieve it**. They consist of the following components:

- **Target**: Defines where you want to reach.
- **Baseline**: Identifies your current state.
- **Trend**: Describes the current velocity or trajectory.
- **Time Frame**: Sets clear boundaries for the desired change.

---

## Types of Goals

1. **Investment Goals**:  
   Represent a future state you want to achieve.

2. **Baseline Goals**:  
   Describe aspects of the present that you aim to preserve.

Pairing these two types of goals ensures balance, helping to avoid unintended consequences by addressing both **aspirations** and **status quo**.

For instance, when setting an investment goal, include **baseline metrics** (countervailing metrics) to monitor areas that shouldn’t regress as you progress toward your investment goal.

---

## Using Goals in Planning

Goals are most effective when integrated into a structured **planning process**. During this phase:

- **Focus on baseline goals**: You’ll likely identify more baseline goals than investment goals.
- **Pair goals with metrics**: Metrics help to track both progress and preservation.

---

## Starting with OKRs

**OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** offer a lightweight, adaptable framework for goal setting:

- **Objectives**: Qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve.
- **Key Results**: Quantifiable outcomes to measure progress.

This structure is a practical starting point for defining and managing goals effectively.

# Guiding Broad Organisational Change with Metrics

Metrics are a powerful tool for leading change, even without direct organisational authority. Here's a step-by-step approach:

---

## 1. Explore
- Start by getting data into an **explorable format** within your data warehouse.
- Make the data accessible for analysis and insights.

---

## 2. Dive
- Conduct a deep dive to understand the **levers** that influence the metrics.

---

## 3. Attribute
- During the dive, identify the **team** nominally accountable for the metric's performance.

---

## 4. Contextualise
- Build context around each team's performance by:
  - **Benchmarking** against small cohorts, such as:
    - Backend
    - Frontend
    - Infrastructure
  - Highlight comparisons that make performance clear.

---

## 5. Nudge
- Encourage teams to take action:
  - Send **push notifications** (e.g., emails) to teams whose metrics have recently changed.
  - Track both:
    - **Absolute change** in the metric.
    - **Benchmarked performance** against their cohort.
- For more insights, refer to the recommended read: **[Nudge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3450744-nudge)**.

---

## 6. Baseline
- In cases where contextualised nudges aren't effective:
  - **Agree on baseline metrics** to set clear expectations for performance.

---

## 7. Review
- As a last resort, conduct **monthly or quarterly reviews**:
  - Evaluate each team's performance.
  - Address recurring issues and provide targeted feedback.

# Presenting to Senior Leadership

When preparing a presentation for senior leadership, consider the following tips to make your message clear and impactful:

---

## General Tips for Preparation

1. **Communication is company-specific**  
   Tailor your approach to align with your company’s culture and communication style.

2. **Start with the conclusion**  
   Present the key takeaway first rather than building up to it gradually.

3. **Frame why the topic matters**  
   Explain the relevance of your work to the company and its objectives.

4. **Everyone loves a narrative**  
   Use storytelling to connect the audience to your work.

5. **Prepare for detours**  
   Anticipate unexpected questions or tangents, and be ready to steer back to the main point.

6. **Answer directly**  
   Don’t shy away from challenges; instead, address them with plans and solutions.

7. **Deep in the data**  
   Spend time thoroughly exploring the data to understand all facets of the issue.

8. **Derive actions from principles**  
   Share the mental model behind your decision-making process to build trust and clarity.

9. **Discuss the details**  
   Be ready to explain granular details if asked.

10. **Prepare a lot; practice a little**  
    Leadership discussions often take unexpected turns, so prioritize deep preparation over rigid practice.

11. **Make a clear ask**  
    Frame your goal at the start of the meeting to set clear expectations.

---

## Approach to Presenting to Senior Leaders

1. **Tie the topic to business value**  
   Start by connecting your work to the company’s goals and objectives.

2. **Establish a historical narrative**  
   Provide context by explaining how the situation has evolved over time.

3. **Explicit ask**  
   Clearly state what you need from the leadership team.

4. **Data-driven diagnosis**  
   Present your analysis with data to back up your insights.

5. **Decision-making principles**  
   Explain the principles guiding your decisions to help align understanding.

6. **What's next and when it’ll be done**  
   Share your next steps and timelines.
 
7. **Return to explicit ask**  
   End by reiterating your ask to leave a lasting impression. 

# Time Management

Time management is an enduring meta-problem for leadership. To improve your ability to manage time, focus on these impactful changes:

---

## Key Strategies for Time Management

1. **Quarterly Time Retrospective**  
   Review and categorise your calendar from the past three months to evaluate how you’ve invested your time.

2. **Prioritise Long-Term Success Over Short-Term Quality**  
   Focus on initiatives that ensure long-term success, even if they feel less rewarding in the short term.

3. **Finish Small, Leveraged Things**  
   Complete tasks that create more bandwidth for future work.

4. **Stop Doing Things**  
   Clearly communicate to your team and management that you’ll no longer handle certain responsibilities.

5. **Size Backward, Not Forward**  
   Define the number of hours you can dedicate to specific activities (e.g., two hours per week for skip-level meetings) and fit as many as possible within that limit.

6. **Delegate Working "In the System"**  
   Design a transition plan to enable someone else to take over operational tasks.

7. **Trust the System You Build**  
   Rely on the processes and systems you’ve put in place.

8. **Decouple Participation from Productivity**  
   Avoid the assumption that attending meetings or events equals productivity.

9. **Hire Until You Are Slightly Ahead of Growth**  
   Expand your team before reaching a point of overwhelm.

10. **Calendar Blocking**  
    Schedule three or four two-hour blocks throughout the week for focused, uninterrupted work.

11. **Get Administrative Support**  
    When all other strategies are exhausted, delegating administrative tasks can significantly reduce interruptions and improve focus.

---

## Final Note

You can become less busy by prioritising tasks with the goal of reducing your overall workload. Avoid the common misconception that being busy equates to being productive.

# Communities of Learning

To build effective communities of learning, consider the following recommended approaches:

---

## Key Strategies

1. **Be a Facilitator, Not a Lecturer**  
   Encourage learning from peers rather than relying solely on a single presenter.

2. **Brief Presentations, Long Discussions**  
   Limit the presentation to around five minutes, then move into extended discussions.

3. **Small Breakout Groups**  
   Create small, safe spaces for individuals to learn and engage in discussions. This ensures everyone has a chance to participate.

4. **Bringing Learning to the Full Group**  
   Allow each breakout group to share their discussions and insights with the larger group.

5. **Choose Topics That People Already Know About**  
   Select topics that participants are familiar with or have considered before to drive meaningful conversations.

6. **Encourage Tenured Folks to Attend**  
   Senior or tenured members often skip these sessions. Encourage their participation to enrich discussions.

7. **Optional Pre-Reads**  
   Provide a list of optional pre-reads to help participants prepare and engage more effectively.

8. **Checking In**  
   Begin by having each participant give a 20-30 second introduction, including:
   - Their name.
   - Their team.
   - One sentence about what’s on their mind.

---

By fostering a collaborative environment, these strategies can help create impactful and engaging learning communities.

# Consider the Team You Have for Senior Positions

Promoting internal candidates for senior positions requires careful evaluation. Announcing each position and allowing individuals to apply is only the beginning. The real challenge lies in the evaluation process.

---

## Key Evaluation Categories

When assessing candidates for senior roles, ensure they are tested in the following areas:

1. **Partnership**  
   Have they demonstrated effective collaboration with peers and the team they've managed?

2. **Execution**  
   Are they capable of supporting the team in achieving operational excellence?

3. **Vision**  
   Can they articulate a compelling and energising vision for their team's future state and scope?

4. **Strategy**  
   Are they able to identify the necessary steps to turn their vision into reality?

5. **Spoken and Written Communication**  
   Can they effectively explain complex topics in both written and verbal forms?

6. **Stakeholder Management**  
   Do they make others, particularly executives, feel heard and valued?

---

## Tools for Testing Candidates

To evaluate these categories, use the following tools:

1. **Peer and Team Feedback**  
   Collect written feedback from peers and the team. Actively listen to dissenters and consider their concerns.

2. **90-Day Plan**  
   Ask the candidate to create a 90-day plan outlining how they would transition into the role and their initial priorities.

3. **Vision/Strategy Document**  
   Have the candidate write a document detailing:
   - Where the team will be in two to three years (vision).
   - The steps to get there (strategy).

4. **Vision/Strategy Presentation**  
   Request the candidate to present their vision/strategy document to a group of three to four peers.

5. **Executive Presentation**  
   Have the candidate present their strategy document one-on-one to an executive.
