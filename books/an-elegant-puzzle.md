# Introduction

Organizational design focuses on placing the right people in the right roles, giving them the authority to make decisions, and holding them accountable for their outcomes.

---

# Organizations

An organization is a group of individuals working together toward a common objective.

The goal of organizational design is to identify why some organizations foster high energy and productivity, while others generate more friction, frustration, and internal politics.

# Sizing Teams

A core challenge in organizational design is determining the appropriate size for teams.

- **Optimal Team Size for Managers**:  
  Managers should ideally oversee six to eight engineers. This allows sufficient time for coaching, coordination, and advancing the team’s mission through activities like strategy development and leading change initiatives.

- **Smaller Teams (<4 Engineers)**:  
  Managers of very small teams often act as Tech Lead Managers, actively contributing to design and implementation tasks alongside their team.

- **Larger Teams (>8–9 Engineers)**:  
  Managers of larger teams tend to adopt more of a coaching role, acting as a safety net and resolving issues as they arise.

  # Metrics and Baselines

## Decoupling the "What" from the "How"

Goals are structured to separate **what you want to achieve** from **how you plan to achieve it**. They consist of the following components:

- **Target**: Defines where you want to reach.
- **Baseline**: Identifies your current state.
- **Trend**: Describes the current velocity or trajectory.
- **Time Frame**: Sets clear boundaries for the desired change.

---

## Types of Goals

1. **Investment Goals**:  
   Represent a future state you want to achieve.

2. **Baseline Goals**:  
   Describe aspects of the present that you aim to preserve.

Pairing these two types of goals ensures balance, helping to avoid unintended consequences by addressing both **aspirations** and **status quo**.

For instance, when setting an investment goal, include **baseline metrics** (countervailing metrics) to monitor areas that shouldn’t regress as you progress toward your investment goal.

---

## Using Goals in Planning

Goals are most effective when integrated into a structured **planning process**. During this phase:

- **Focus on baseline goals**: You’ll likely identify more baseline goals than investment goals.
- **Pair goals with metrics**: Metrics help to track both progress and preservation.

---

## Starting with OKRs

**OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** offer a lightweight, adaptable framework for goal setting:

- **Objectives**: Qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve.
- **Key Results**: Quantifiable outcomes to measure progress.

This structure is a practical starting point for defining and managing goals effectively.

# Guiding Broad Organisational Change with Metrics

Metrics are a powerful tool for leading change, even without direct organisational authority. Here's a step-by-step approach:

---

## 1. Explore
- Start by getting data into an **explorable format** within your data warehouse.
- Make the data accessible for analysis and insights.

---

## 2. Dive
- Conduct a deep dive to understand the **levers** that influence the metrics.

---

## 3. Attribute
- During the dive, identify the **team** nominally accountable for the metric's performance.

---

## 4. Contextualise
- Build context around each team's performance by:
  - **Benchmarking** against small cohorts, such as:
    - Backend
    - Frontend
    - Infrastructure
  - Highlight comparisons that make performance clear.

---

## 5. Nudge
- Encourage teams to take action:
  - Send **push notifications** (e.g., emails) to teams whose metrics have recently changed.
  - Track both:
    - **Absolute change** in the metric.
    - **Benchmarked performance** against their cohort.
- For more insights, refer to the recommended read: **[Nudge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3450744-nudge)**.

---

## 6. Baseline
- In cases where contextualised nudges aren't effective:
  - **Agree on baseline metrics** to set clear expectations for performance.

---

## 7. Review
- As a last resort, conduct **monthly or quarterly reviews**:
  - Evaluate each team's performance.
  - Address recurring issues and provide targeted feedback.
