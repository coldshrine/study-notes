# Organizations

An organization is a group of individuals working together toward a common objective.

# Sizing Teams

A core challenge in organizational design is determining the appropriate size for teams.

- **Optimal Team Size for Managers**:  
  Managers should ideally oversee six to eight engineers. This allows sufficient time for coaching, coordination, and advancing the team’s mission through activities like strategy development and leading change initiatives.

- **Smaller Teams (<4 Engineers)**:  
  Managers of very small teams often act as Tech Lead Managers, actively contributing to design and implementation tasks alongside their team.

- **Larger Teams (>8–9 Engineers)**:  
  Managers of larger teams tend to adopt more of a coaching role, acting as a safety net and resolving issues as they arise.
