# Introduction

Organizational design focuses on placing the right people in the right roles, giving them the authority to make decisions, and holding them accountable for their outcomes.

# Organizations

An organization is a group of individuals working together toward a common objective.

The goal of organizational design is to identify why some organizations foster high energy and productivity, while others generate more friction, frustration, and internal politics.

# Sizing Teams

A core challenge in organizational design is determining the appropriate size for teams.

- **Optimal Team Size for Managers**:  
  Managers should ideally oversee six to eight engineers. This allows sufficient time for coaching, coordination, and advancing the team’s mission through activities like strategy development and leading change initiatives.

- **Smaller Teams (<4 Engineers)**:  
  Managers of very small teams often act as Tech Lead Managers, actively contributing to design and implementation tasks alongside their team.

- **Larger Teams (>8–9 Engineers)**:  
  Managers of larger teams tend to adopt more of a coaching role, acting as a safety net and resolving issues as they arise.

  # Metrics and Baselines

## Decoupling the "What" from the "How"

Goals are structured to separate **what you want to achieve** from **how you plan to achieve it**. They consist of the following components:

- **Target**: Defines where you want to reach.
- **Baseline**: Identifies your current state.
- **Trend**: Describes the current velocity or trajectory.
- **Time Frame**: Sets clear boundaries for the desired change.

## Types of Goals

1. **Investment Goals**:  
   Represent a future state you want to achieve.

2. **Baseline Goals**:  
   Describe aspects of the present that you aim to preserve.

Pairing these two types of goals ensures balance, helping to avoid unintended consequences by addressing both **aspirations** and **status quo**.

For instance, when setting an investment goal, include **baseline metrics** (countervailing metrics) to monitor areas that shouldn’t regress as you progress toward your investment goal.

## Using Goals in Planning

Goals are most effective when integrated into a structured **planning process**. During this phase:

- **Focus on baseline goals**: You’ll likely identify more baseline goals than investment goals.
- **Pair goals with metrics**: Metrics help to track both progress and preservation.

## Starting with OKRs

**OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** offer a lightweight, adaptable framework for goal setting:

- **Objectives**: Qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve.
- **Key Results**: Quantifiable outcomes to measure progress.

This structure is a practical starting point for defining and managing goals effectively.
