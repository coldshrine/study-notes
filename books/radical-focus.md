> Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what you need done and let them surprise you with their results â€“ General George Patton

You can release all the features you want, but if it doesn't solve the underlying business problem, you haven't really solved anything.

Executives and other stakeholders all too often come up with the quarterly "roadmap" of features and projects and then pass them down to the product teams, essentially telling them how to solve the underlying business problems. Progress is measured by output and not by outcome.


## Introduction

Ideas, like NDAs, aren't worth the paper they are printed on. **Ideas are easier to come up, what's hard, really hard is moving from an idea to reality.**

It's not important to protect an idea. It's important to protect the time it takes to make it real. You need a system to keep you and your team aimed at your goal.

**A startup enemy is time, and the enemy of timely execution is distraction.**

## The framework for Radical Focus

### Why we can't get things done

If you are CEO or a manager, you want things for your company. Even in the most successful companies, the thing we have determined must happen, often doesn't. This is due:
1. **We haven't prioritised our goals**
    > If everything is important, nothing really is.


    You could probably put stuff in order of importance, choose to work one thing at a time. Setting a single Objective with only three Key Results to measure keeps you focused.
2. **We haven't communicated the goal obsessively and comprehensively**
    > When you are tired of saying it, people are starting to hear it.


    Once you have the goal projects must be evaluated against it. By repeating the goal in commitment meetings, weekly status emails or Friday wins celebrations, we assure that the goal is in the front of everyone's mind and tied to all activities.
3. **We don't have a plan to get things done**. Will power is a finite resource. you need a process that helps you make sense of the work you need to do, and keeps you on track even when you are tired.

4. **We haven't made time for what matters**. The Eisenhower Box (Important/Urgent matrix) is a time management tool. Urgent things get done because the pressure of time. Unless we bring that pressure to important but not urgent things, they won't get done. Block out time to do what matters. Nothing is as invigorating as a deadline. By committing to work towards the Objective, you assure you'll be held accountable to progress.

5. **We give up instead of iterate**. You'll fail the first time you implement OKRs. Maybe a company will find they have sandbaggers where no one ever sets hard goals; a company that is afraid to fail. Or maybe you have a company where no one makes their Key Results, because people over-promise and under-deliver. The most common fail is no follow-through, people set OKRs just to ignore them afterward. Successful one try again in. The only hope for success is iteration; you track what works, and what does not.
