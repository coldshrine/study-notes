> Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what you need done and let them surprise you with their results â€“ General George Patton

You can release all the features you want, but if it doesn't solve the underlying business problem, you haven't really solved anything.

Executives and other stakeholders all too often come up with the quarterly "roadmap" of features and projects and then pass them down to the product teams, essentially telling them how to solve the underlying business problems. Progress is measured by output and not by outcome.


## Introduction

Ideas, like NDAs, aren't worth the paper they are printed on. **Ideas are easier to come up, what's hard, really hard is moving from an idea to reality.**

It's not important to protect an idea. It's important to protect the time it takes to make it real. You need a system to keep you and your team aimed at your goal.

**A startup enemy is time, and the enemy of timely execution is distraction.**

## The framework for Radical Focus

### Why we can't get things done

If you are CEO or a manager, you want things for your company. Even in the most successful companies, the thing we have determined must happen, often doesn't. This is due:
1. **We haven't prioritised our goals**
    > If everything is important, nothing really is.
