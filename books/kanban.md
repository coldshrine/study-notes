## Solving an agile manager's dilemma

> Our deadlines were set by managers without regard to engineering complexity, risk, or project size.

> Changes suggested out of context would be rejected by the workers who lived and understood the project context.

Drum-Buffer-Rope is an example of a class of solutions known as pull systems. The side effect of pull systems is that they limit work-in-progress (WIP) to some agreed-upon quantity, thus preventing workers from becoming overloaded.

## Kanban

_Kan-ban_ is a Japanese word that literally means "signal card" in english. Cards are used as a signal to tell an upstream step in the process to produce more. Kanban is fundamental to the _kaizen_ (continuous improvement).

Workflow visualisation, work item types, cadence, classes of service, specific management reporting, and operation reviews is what defines the Kanban Method.

### Kanban system

A number of cards equivalent to the agreed capacity of a system are placed in circulation. One card attaches to one piece of work. Each card acts as a signalling mechanism. A new piece of work can be started only when a card is available. The free card is attached to a piece of work and follows it as it flows through the system. When there are no more free cards, no additional work can be started. Any new work must wait in a queue until a card becomes available. When some work is completed, its card is detached and recycled. With a card now free, a new piece of work in the queuing can be started.

This is known as a pull system because new work is pulled into the system when there is capacity to handle it, rather being pushed into the system based on demand. A pull system cannot be overloaded if capacity, as determined by the number of signal cards in circulation, has been set appropriately.
