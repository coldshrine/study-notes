# Amazon EMR

Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) is a fully managed cloud service designed to simplify the deployment, configuration, and operation of big data frameworks like **Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark,** and other open-source data processing tools on AWS. EMR allows organizations to process vast amounts of data quickly, cost-effectively, and at scale, using **Amazon EC2 instances** that can be dynamically adjusted to meet specific workloads.

One of the most common use cases for Amazon EMR is running **Apache Spark jobs** to process and analyze large datasets. EMR’s integration with **Apache Spark** enables efficient data processing for tasks such as **data transformation, ETL, and machine learning model training**.

For transaction-based analytics, **Delta Lake** can be used in conjunction with Amazon EMR. Delta Lake provides ACID transaction support, scalable metadata handling, and time travel (bi-temporal querying), enabling powerful and reliable data lake architectures.
