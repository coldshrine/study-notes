# Amazon EMR

Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) is a fully managed cloud service designed to simplify the deployment, configuration, and operation of big data frameworks like **Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark,** and other open-source data processing tools on AWS. EMR allows organizations to process vast amounts of data quickly, cost-effectively, and at scale, using **Amazon EC2 instances** that can be dynamically adjusted to meet specific workloads.

One of the most common use cases for Amazon EMR is running **Apache Spark jobs** to process and analyze large datasets. EMR’s integration with **Apache Spark** enables efficient data processing for tasks such as **data transformation, ETL, and machine learning model training**.

For transaction-based analytics, **Delta Lake** can be used in conjunction with Amazon EMR. Delta Lake provides ACID transaction support, scalable metadata handling, and time travel (bi-temporal querying), enabling powerful and reliable data lake architectures.

## Key Features

- **Managed Big Data Frameworks**: EMR makes it easy to run distributed computing frameworks like **Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, and others**. These frameworks are essential for processing massive datasets across large clusters, and EMR manages the complexity of deploying and maintaining them.

- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Amazon EMR allows you to resize clusters dynamically based on your workload. Whether you're processing a small dataset or performing complex analytics on petabytes of data, you can scale your clusters up or down to optimize both performance and cost.

- **Cost Efficiency**: With EMR, you only pay for the resources you use while your jobs are running, making it cost-efficient for a wide range of use cases. Additionally, AWS Graviton-based instances offer a price-performance advantage, delivering up to 40% better performance for certain types of workloads compared to traditional x86 instances.

- **Integrated with AWS Ecosystem**: Amazon EMR integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like Amazon S3 (for storage), Amazon RDS (for relational databases), AWS Glue (for data cataloging), and Amazon Redshift (for analytics). This allows for an end-to-end solution for big data processing and analytics in the cloud.

## Cluster Architecture

An Amazon EMR cluster consists of different types of nodes, each serving specific purposes in data processing:

1. **Master Node**:
   - The master node manages the entire EMR cluster by running the necessary software to coordinate the distribution of tasks and data. It is responsible for task assignment, failure recovery, and managing cluster health. **It does not participate in data storage or computation.**


2. **Core Nodes**:
   - Core nodes store data and perform the computational tasks needed for data processing. These nodes are vital for both **storage** and **computation**, and they ensure that the data is replicated and available during the cluster’s lifetime.

3. **Task Nodes (Optional)**:
   - Task nodes are optional nodes that serve to augment the cluster’s processing capacity. Unlike core nodes, task nodes **do not store data** but are dedicated to executing tasks assigned by the master node. Task nodes are ideal for **scaling computation** when workloads demand additional resources. They can also be provisioned as **spot instances**, offering further cost savings.

## Storage Options

EMR supports several storage options to store input data, output data, and logs. Choosing the right file system depends on the specific needs of your application and the longevity of the data.

1. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**:
   - HDFS is a distributed, scalable file system designed to store large data sets reliably. It splits data into blocks (typically 128MB) and replicates those blocks across different instances in the cluster, ensuring redundancy. However, one key disadvantage of HDFS is that it uses **ephemeral storage**; when the cluster terminates, the data is lost. This makes HDFS ideal for temporary or intermediate storage during data processing tasks.

2. **EMR File System (EMRFS)**:
   - EMRFS is an implementation of the Hadoop file system that allows Amazon EMR to read and write data directly to **Amazon S3**. This provides a highly durable, cost-effective storage solution, as **Amazon S3** offers **persistent storage**, and your data remains intact even if the EMR cluster is terminated. **EMRFS** enables you to store large amounts of data without worrying about data loss.

3. **Local File System**:
   - The local file system refers to the local disk attached to the EC2 instances used in the EMR cluster. This is **ephemeral storage**, meaning data is lost when the instance is terminated. It is often used for caching or storing temporary data during the processing phases of a job.

## External Metastores

By default, Hive stores its metastore information in a **MySQL** database located on the primary node’s file system. However, when the cluster is terminated, the primary node and its data are lost, including the metastore. To ensure the persistence of your metastore, it is recommended to use an **external metastore** that survives the termination of the cluster.

Options for an external metastore:

1. **AWS Glue Data Catalog**:
   - The AWS Glue Data Catalog is a fully managed, scalable metadata repository that allows you to store your Hive metastore outside the EMR cluster. It also integrates with various other AWS services like Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift, making it an ideal solution for managing metadata in a cloud-native environment.

2. **Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora**:
   - Alternatively, you can use Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora to host your external Hive metastore. These managed database services offer high availability, durability, and scalability, which are crucial for storing large volumes of metadata.

When adding data directly to the file system (like HDFS or S3) without updating the Hive metastore, Hive might not recognize new partitions. In such cases, you can run the `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` command to synchronize the metadata with the actual data layout in the file system.

- **MSCK REPAIR TABLE**: This command scans the file system for new partitions added after table creation. It compares the file system's partition structure with the metadata stored in the Hive metastore. If it detects new partitions, it adds them to the table metadata.

This is especially important for environments where new data is frequently added outside of Hive's normal partitioning system (e.g., batch processes that add files directly to HDFS or S3).

## Cluster Types: Transient vs Long-Running

Amazon EMR clusters can be categorized into two types, based on their operational lifespan and use case:

1. **Transient Clusters**:
   - Transient clusters are temporary clusters launched for specific, short-term tasks such as periodic batch processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs, or any job that completes within a defined time frame. Once the job completes, the cluster is automatically terminated. **Cost efficiency** is a significant advantage, as you only pay for the resources used during the job’s execution.

2. **Long-Running Clusters**:
   - Long-running clusters are designed to stay active over extended periods. These clusters are typically used for **interactive data analysis**, applications that require continuous access to processed data, or services that must be available at all times. While these clusters offer **continuous access** to your data and analytics tools, they incur ongoing costs for as long as the cluster remains active.

## Amazon EC2 Graviton

The AWS Graviton2 processors are custom-designed Arm-based processors that provide significant price-performance advantages for workloads in Amazon EC2. When used with Amazon EMR, Graviton2 instances offer up to **40% better price-performance** compared to equivalent x86-based EC2 instances. These processors are especially effective for data-intensive and cloud-native workloads, such as those typically found in big data processing tasks with Apache Spark and Hadoop.

For organizations seeking to reduce costs while maintaining high performance in their EMR clusters, using Graviton-powered instances can be a compelling alternative to traditional x86-based instances.

## Spark Memory Overhead

When running Apache Spark jobs, whether on Amazon EMR or another environment, it's important to be aware that Spark adds an overhead for memory allocation to both drivers and executors. This overhead is typically around **10%** of the requested memory.
