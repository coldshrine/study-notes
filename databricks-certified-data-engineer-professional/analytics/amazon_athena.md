# Amazon Athena

Amazon Athena is a serverless interactive query service that simplifies data analysis by allowing users to run SQL queries directly on data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Athena is highly scalable and cost-effective, enabling querying of large datasets without the need for complex infrastructure or resource management.

Athena allows you to execute ad-hoc SQL queries on your S3 data using standard SQL syntax. By simply pointing Athena at your S3 data and running queries, you can quickly analyze large datasets and obtain results in seconds. Athena automatically scales based on data volume and query complexity, and you only pay for the data scanned.
